### Title: Bower's Domain

# Opening Scene:

The movie opens with a shot of Bower, a middle-aged man sitting alone in a dimly lit room, surrounded by empty bottles and cigarette butts. A knock on the door jolts him awake, and he stumbles to answer it. It's the landlord, reminding him that he's behind on rent again and threatening to auction off his prized possession, a record player his deceased brother-in-law gave him right before he passed.

# Act 1:

As the movie progresses, we see Bower's life crumbling before his eyes. His nephew's suicide attempt, the death of the family dogs, the theft of his savings and identity, and the cancellation of his adoption plan all take a toll on him. He hits rock bottom when he tries to take his own life after getting into trouble with the cartel on a family vacation to Mexico. However, he is interrupted by his children, and he decides to fight to stay alive for them.

# Act 2:

Bower's resilience is put to the test when his entire family is killed by the cartel. He is forced to rebuild his life from scratch and eventually meets and marries a new wife. However, the marriage doesn't work out, and they divorce, snuffing out the little light at the end of the tunnel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   # Act 3:

In the final act of the movie, Bower becomes a recluse, retreating to his own domain, a secluded cabin in the woods. There, he becomes obsessed with the idea of revenge against the cartel that destroyed his family. He spends years plotting and preparing for his revenge, becoming more and more isolated from the outside world.

As Bower's plans come to fruition, the movie takes a dark turn. He kidnaps members of the cartel and tortures them in his basement, seeking information and revenge. However, his actions have consequences, and he soon finds himself hunted by both the cartel and the authorities.

The movie ends with Bower's capture and arrest, and a final shot of him sitting alone in a jail cell, reflecting on the events that led him there. The record player his brother-in-law gave him is playing softly in the background, a reminder of the life he once had and the tragedy that led him down a dark path.
